However, dawn showed them that they were actually off the coast of the large muslim city of Mogadishu. Da Gama chose not to make contact with the town, and simply because it was inhabited by Muslims, he bombarded the harbor at close range with his ship's cannon and inflicted a considerable amount of damage.
