	#-#Champa was a traditionally tolerant kingdom that, like many realms in South East Asia, had long practiced a hybrid Hindu-Buddhist religion interlaced with native animist ideas such as ancestor worship and veneration of the dead. The two main Cham socio-cultural groups were the Balamon, who were mostly Hindu but later came to adopt Sunni Islam, and the Bani, who followed a syncretic faith that combined elements of Hinduism and Shi'a Islam. As per the caste system, the Balamon and Bani were often segregated, and marriage between the two groups was prohibited. Though a deeply isolated kingdom with little direct diplomacy with neighbouring states, both main branches of Islam permeated Champa during the mid-16th century, and by the 17th century its rulers had adopted Islam.
